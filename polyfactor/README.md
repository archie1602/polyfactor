# polyfactor

Enables to [factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization_of_polynomials) polynomials over various mathematical [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)).

**Note: Currently, only factorization over GF(p) is supported.**

## factorization over GF(p)
To factor polynomials over GF(p), the following 3 methods are supported:
1. Berlekamp
2. Cantor-Zassenhaus
3. Kaltofen-Shoup
